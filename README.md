# Chiptheory

This is a fork of [Chip Player JS](https://github.com/mmontag/chip-player-js) that focuses on music theory analysis of NES tracks. 
All credits for tremendous original work go to Matt Montag and all contributors to libraries that he managed to wire together. I'm just writing a tiny layer on top. The licensing is the same.
